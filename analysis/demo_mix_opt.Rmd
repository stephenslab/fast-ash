## SCRIPT PARAMETERS

```{r settings}
n  <- 1000  # Number of samples.
se <- 1     # Standard errors ("noise").

# These parameters specify the mixture-of-normals prior. We use this 
# same prior to simulate the data.
s  <- c(1,0.1,0.01)      # Standard deviations.
q  <- c(0.01,0.09,0.90)  # Mixture weights.
```

## GENERATE DATA SET

```{r gen_data}

```

## Solve the optimization problem


```{r run_ipsolver}
```

## Session information.

```{r session_info}
print(sessionInfo())
```
