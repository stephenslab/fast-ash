Special thanks [John Blischak][john-site] at the University of Chicago 
for sharing his workflow template. Our workflow was inspired by his [site][singleCellSeq] 
that documents the steps for preprocessing and statistical analysis 
in a project that investigates experimental artifacts in single-cell RNA-seq data.
